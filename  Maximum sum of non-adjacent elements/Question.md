You are given an array/list of ‘N’ integers. You are supposed to return the maximum sum of the subsequence with the constraint that no two elements are adjacent in the given array/list.

Note:
A subsequence of an array/list is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array/list, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
